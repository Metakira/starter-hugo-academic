I am a Bengaluru based New Media artist, Creative technologist and Computational designer who likes to build cool audiovisual stuff in a variety of domains, but primarily in XR and immersive media, and this website serves as a documentation of my professional work as well as an outlet for personal opinions. Please see my [current research statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Soz_x1HDM0kSgqYokWD8f_XxeeeMIdf6/view?usp=sharing) for a full disclosure of my varied interests in the realms of New Media art, Creative Technology and Computational design.

I try to keep an archive of work both new and old [here](https://lekha.cc/artist/mxchina), a logbook of monthly updates [here](https://misskey.art/@georgepanicker) and documentation of my visual portfolio [here](https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/gearworks). I also run a personal net-art intermedia project called ["INDU"](https://mxchina.neocities.org/) where I attempt to formulate my thoughts on how we can rethink Indian ideas for the emerging world of New Media and Cyberculture.
