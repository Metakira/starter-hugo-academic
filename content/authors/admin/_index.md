I am a Bengaluru based practitioner who works across New Media art, Creative technology, Computational design and Earth Systems Science. This website serves as a documentation of my professional work as well as an outlet for personal opinions. My hobbies include a variety of things, such as reading books, birdwatching, experimenting with computer music, visiting sites and writing on a variety of topics that I like. I also try to keep a logbook of my monthly explorations on my [misskey instance](https://misskey.art/@georgepanicker/gallery) when I am not occupied with stuff.
