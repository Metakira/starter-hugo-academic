I am a a Bengaluru based New Media artist, creative technologist and computational designer who works to create visual and audial works in the domains of immersive and synthetic media. My personal research interests are at the moment budding but exend across ArtScience, applications of complexity theory to design, epistemics and policy in the digital humanities, Network theory, biofeedback via neural interfaces and Unitary Urbanism. In the pursuit of these interests, I do my very best to take the highest road at all times and to contribute as much as possible to an ethical, equitable and sustainable society for the happiness and well-being of all human beings. 

My core values as a person are sharing knowledge between experts and non-experts alike for a discursive route to best practices, mindful thought applied to the design and development of new media for the creation of a compassionate, accepting and infinitely more capable society, and maintaining the mindset of the "eternal beginner" who seeks to continually learn from recognizing the importance that all human beings can bring to the discussion, even if you do not necessarily agree with them :)

In the fields of sound and music, I try my best to have test, explore and have fun with ideas I find fascinating. Currently, I am interested in procedural Xenharmonics (particularly the work of Erv Wilson), livecoding and algorithmic composition, the Indian raga system, ambisonics/spatial music, Hyper-glitchy sounds as well as interesting and experimental modes of making electronic music. 

My portfolio is currently under construction and is soon to be fully updated, but expect to see cool stuff soon!
