###### Edit: Bit of an apology as my mental and physical health have been somewhat poor since graduation a month ago, but I'm doing much better now.

As computational designers, we are the fore-bearers of massive paradigmatic shift, a change in tide which has not been recognized since the very roots of the profession. As design breaks away from its  syllabi that were articulated to stay true to its Industrial, Neoliberal and Capitalist Western roots, the task for the computational designer now venturing into new ground would be the task of re-framing the idea of what a designer does and how a designer may do it. 

For centuries, processes in all fields , design included, have been aspirationally tailgating the field of Science, and with it the static mechanistic worldview of the Newtonian era, where all things are fixed into place by immutable laws of nature, as if they were gears in synchrony. Yet now, as we enter the "century of biology" and AI is poised to leapfrog our progress towards a radical new future in the realms of synthetic nano-biotech and immersive media spaces, we must now examine our changing role as a designer, one who rejects the burden called the limitations of Human knowledge. 

Like Kandinsky, the great painter, deconstructs in his text "Concerning the Spiritual in Art", great masters in all fields, whether that be art, science, design, technology or philosophy, have all earned their mastery from being eternal students of Nature as intellectual stock. Our planet is not just a "standing reserve" as Heidegger would have put it. It's not just a pool of resources to pillage and exploit, but an active dynamic creative force that's been at forefront of all these fields for milennia, its brilliance still escaping our limited brains. The Earth is the source of all the magic that we demonstrate in our modern day rituals, and yet deeply steeped in our ignorance we forget the fact that, as Pink Floyd put it in the "Division Bell", she really may take it back some day.

As we look on to the monumentous task of setting the bedrock for what it means to design computationally, I think it's best that we set aside the enormous arrogance and hubris that the design field and its self appointed "industry leaders" display in full effect today, and instead become humble students of the greatest force of design on the planet: The Earth itself. 

## Geophilosophy 

The Earth, through the infinite creativity of environmental processes shaping genetic material, is the ultimate master at designing anything we can imagine today, and many a designer have recognized this fact. The ability of genetic material to reach similar and different solutions to environmental challenges via convergent and divergent evolution is a testament to the living planet's genius as creating a varied array of solutions to wide range of extremely different problems.

This incredible potential in the Earth's own natural processes to serve as a foundation rock is where I find Deleuze and Guattari's idea of "Geophilosophy" to be of particular importance. The idea of geophilosophy is very simple: Use the Earth's many phenomena as philosophical material for abstract human applications, considering how most of our mechanisms in human society derive from the humanities, which are themselves heavily dependent on the realm of philosophy. Deleuze and Guattari set out to do this very directly in their opus "*A thousand Plateaus*" and their later work "*What is Philosophy?"* where they borrow a number of natural processes such as stratification, ecological niche theory and tetra-valence as material for political application. 

This may sound like a very absurd and strange idea to people unfamiliar with experimental philosophy, yet interestingly has ***already been applied to the design discipline.*** Take for example Don Norman's use of Affordances in *The Design of Everyday Things.* Affordance theory in the book is laid out and mapped for use in a wide variety of human centered design applications, yet the roots of the theory itself can be traced back to the ecologist and Animal scientist James Gibson's original coinage of the term in his 1979 book *The ecological approach to animal perception.* The original context of the "Affordance" lies in the study of how an animal in its niche adapts to its environment, characterizing its use of the many things an environment can provide it.

So we already have evidence of biological systems and processes being recontextualized to fit human-centered design applications:  A perfect example of Geophilosophy in action. Yet we must go even further back into the past to throttle even a little further into the future

## Bionics

"Bionics" is term sourced from a multitude of origins, but I will deal with two major ones and then trace them out as to what they mean for computational designers.

The first use of the terms I think may be of interest to us as computational designers may be in a formerly infamous but now seminal text titled "Design for the real world" by Victor Papanek, where he attacks the mother disciplines of industrial and graphic design for their contributions to an unsustainable world.

![](https://www.bioniccity.co.uk/uploads/3/7/7/1/37716157/bionics-papanek_orig.png)

 Papanek's often ruthless comments are what led to his ultimate larger exile from the design community:



>
>
> *"Much recent design has satisfied only evanescent wants and desires, while the genuine needs of man have often been neglected. The economic, psychological, spiritual, social, technological, and intellectual needs of a human being are usually more difficult and less profitable to satisfy than the carefully engineered and manipulated “wants” inculcated by fad and fashion”*
>
> "*The cancerous growth of the creative individual expressing himself egocentrically at the expense of spectator and/or consumer has spread from the arts, overrun most of the crafts, and finally reached even into design. No longer does the artist, craftsman, or in some cases the designer, operate with the good of the consumer in mind; rather, many creative statements have become highly individualistic, auto-therapeutic little comments by the artist to himself*"
>
> *"...the designer must be conscious of his social and moral responsibility. For design is the most powerful tool yet given man with which to shape his products, his environments, and, by extension, himself; with it, he must analyse the past as well as the foreseeable future consequences of his acts.
> The job is much harder to do when every part of the designer's life has been conditioned by a market-oriented, profit-directed system such as that in the United States. A radical departure from these manipulated values is difficult to achieve."*
>
> *"As both a designer and teacher, I am compelled to ask myself the question: 'How can we make design better ?' And the general consensus seems to be, both in schools and offices in this country and abroad, that the answers does not lie in teaching more design. Rather, designers and students have to familiarize themselves with many other fields and, by knowing them, redefine the relevance of the designer to our society. The insights of the social sciences, biology, anthropology, politics, engineering, and technology, the behavioural sciences, and much else, must be brought to bear on the design process"*
>
> ***"By now a definition of the word bionics is probably in order: bionics means 'the use of biological prototypes for the design of man-made synthetic systems'. To put it in simpler language: to study basic principles in nature and emerge with applications of principles and processes to the needs of mankind"***
>
> ***" If we attempt to define the word 'bionics' in its narrowest sense, that is on a cybernetic or neurophysiological level, this may be true. But all around us are manifestations in nature or rather primitive structures that have never been properly investigated, exploited, or used by designers, biological schemes that bear investigation and are accessible to anyone free for a walk on a Sunday afternoon."***
>
>

Yet I believe that his chapter on Bionics in *Design for the real world* provides a clue for us computational designers to work with, the large possibilities for geophilosophical approaches to take place within the computer. Papanek was talking about the use of bionics in industrial and environmental design, yet I doubt even he knew how far reaching these implications would come as Industrial design and Architecture become the mother disciplines of computational design theory, with further implications in [Nanobiotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanobiotechnology).

Consider two parallel tracks that concern design. We find that both Deep Learning and Nature creatively arrive at solutions via evolutionary computation that are highly non intuitive to humans yet far more effective than any human design solution, ***especially at energy efficiency***.

An initial example, the bio-mimetic approach of mimicking the fins of a humpback whale:

![](https://i0.wp.com/pepunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HumpbackWhales.jpg)

When [Scientists examined said Design](https://newatlas.com/bumpy-whale-fins-set-to-spark-a-revolution-in-aerodynamics/9020/):



>
>
> "Current theory would state that the leading edge of a fin, fan or turbine blade should be absolutely straight and smooth for best effect - a 'fact' that has been taken for granted for decades. But the more Fish studied the odd leading-edge bumps, or Tubercles, the more it became apparent that evolution's work on the fin was far ahead of man's best efforts.
>
>  Airfoils fitted with tubercle bumps showed much higher lift efficiency and greater stall resistance than identical airfoils without them. **Turbines fitted with tubercles to the leading edges of each blade are able to produce more power at low fluid speeds, are quieter, and perform much better in turbulent fluid streams**."
>
>

This is a very interesting conclusion, that nature somehow just "works". Let's analyze another poster child of evolutionary design, this antenna.

![](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/IMAGES/st5-antenna.jpg)

Similarly:

>
>
> "*Among the new technologies to be tested aboard the ST5 spaceraft is an antenna that was designed by a computer running a simulation of Darwinian evolution. This evolved antenna was discovered by an evolutionary algorithm running for days on a supercomputer. Its unusual shape is expected because most human antenna designers would never think of such a design. **However, this design works very well in meeting the mission requirements**. In addition, this particular design was rapidly evolved after the orbit changed from the original orbit*"
>
>

We now see the intricate idea that underlies the computational design process: one that channels the power of evolution into computational design via Machine Learning techniques. We already see these nature inspired techniques take shape in the most popular generative design software *Grasshopper 3d*, where one can use plugins such as Wallace, Jellyfish and more to simulate evolution within design parameters and reach new, never before seen design solutions. This new approach rapidly transforms the scale and power of the design discipline, and consequently the powers a designer themselves can access.

### India and the Global south as a treasure trove 

If we cut out and examine the scope and measure of Indian design, it is truly a disgrace. Scores of industry leaders and professionals without a spine bend their backs in servitude to the white man (and recently, the yellow man), their deep trust in the unquestioned supremacy of Western imperial project. Yet as we hear harkening calls for "decolonization" and \
"sustainability", one wonders whether these industry stalwarts would drop the mask as admit a sombre truth that , if we compare analogous homegrown approaches in countries like Japan, ***till date, there has been no such thing as "Indian design"?***

No, I mean this fully when I say it, even if it earns me a target on my forehead. It's time to call a spade a spade and firmly reject any notion that this bourgeosie bootlicking activity we call "Indian design" is not even close to it in idea or method, but instead a outdated tradition that honors  a bygone age that bears no relevance to the massive problems that concern us today. 

But there is hope in the very fact that India, and many countries in the global South, have always been in some shape or form "geophilosophical", in the notion that Indian thought has traditionally not been called philosophy ("love of wisdom") but *Darshan Shastra ("the art of direct inference from observation").*

Let's take for example, Indian music. Unlike the Western system that has historically been a human centric religious affair in its practices and products, the[ Raga system directly imitates the Monsoon Rain](https://eos.org/opinions/the-melodies-of-monsoons-weather-in-indian-classical-music) and biorhythmic circadian rhythms of daytime in a very abstracted sense, thus using the Earth's processes as inspiration for artistic merit. This is in stark contrast to Western systems of thought that traditionally rest their foundations on the christian doctrine, whose implications are put forward by White(1967):

> *Especially in its western form, Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion the world
> has seen.... Christianity in absolute contrast to ancient paganism and Asia’s religions
> \[except, perhaps, Zoroastrianism], not only established a duality of man and nature **but also
> insisted that it is God’s will that man exploit nature for is proper ends** (p. 1205).*

In complete opposition, Indian divinity (similar to many animistic practices in Africa, the First Nations and Latin America) is as Nanditha Krishna outlines:

> *"Nature  is venerated all over India. Each village has a sacred grove presided over by a local deity; every temple has a sacred garden and tree; rivers and lakes are revered; and mountains are the dwelling places of the gods. Nature is divine"*

What we can now formalize as a position of the global south is one directly opposed to the Anthropocentric exploitative worldviews of the West-Led order: That of the Sorcerer.

Sorcerers are a great label to take up as a computational designer, considering the way we operate as media artists and creative technologists, as well as considering the history of the computer itself being a tool of sorcery:

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Qx764i82L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)

Often times, before colonialists wiped out these practices, many regions in the global south were regions that practiced animist magic beliefs, an example being my [home state of Kerala.](https://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2023/Feb/18/the-mages-of-malabar-2548079.html) Animist shamans and magicians used the Earth as the source of their power and the reason for their talent as conjuring up new supernatural tricks and trades, this power being a "totem", literally meaning as related to "the mother". The Great Mother Godess as Gaia or Devi has served many a metaphor throughout ancient cultures, being associated with a living sentient planet. Only recently has this been transformed into a notion of mechanistic  non living machine by Bacon and scientists of the western enlightenment era, a notion that with the rise of studies in the ideas of complexity and information processing mechanisms found in nature, we are beginning to suspect as deeply wrong.

This is where the global south, rich in written and oral lineages of geophilosophy, can now begin to gain a huge advantage as computational designers. For example, the [*Physarealm* plugin for Grasshopper](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/physarealm) 3D, one that directly simulates the processes of the *Physarum Polycephalum* fungi:

*"Physarum polycephalum, literally the "many-headed slime", is a slime mold that inhabits shady, cool, moist areas, such as decaying leaves and logs. P. polycephalum is one of the easiest eukaryotic microbes to grow in culture, and has been used as a model organism for many studies involving amoeboid movement and cell motility. For example, a team of Japanese and Hungarian researchers have shown P. polycephalum can solve the Shortest path problem. When grown in a maze with oatmeal at two spots, P. polycephalum retracts from everywhere in the maze, except the shortest route connecting the two food sources."*

## Conclusion

Decolonizing design as a computational designer is an arduous task, but as the world suffers the blowback of ill-fitting western principles to a new age order, it's up to the many determined practioners in the global south to critically advocate not only for the competitive advantage of their indigenous beliefs and practices, but also that preserving our indigenous cultures and our planet is in our own self interest for a much, much brighter future. In "hacking the monsoon", an article outlining my field trip to rural Udupi and the Rainforests of Agumbe, I outline an experimental attempt as to how we as practitioners in India may begin to tackle this through the modality of sound based approaches such as those of bio-acoustics and eco-acoustics. While we may approach newer problems of debrahmanization as we end the project of Indian design decolonization, like all radical optimists I believe that we can only cross that bridge when we get there :)
