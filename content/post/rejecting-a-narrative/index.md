### Twilight of the idols

Design has been a cultural force of nature since its Bauhasian origins post the second world war, taking roots in the fresh soil of the powerful American economy. Beginning as practice reaching to synthesise the arts and crafts into a new whole, it transformed itself into a vocation, one that promises a future with the hammer called “design thinking”. With a vanguard of practitioners, from IDEO to the Apple Human Interfaces group, a new method to the madness was built from scratch, one that promised an easy, step by step method to solve some of the world’s greatest problems. With a variety of high profile proponents, design thinking entered the boardrooms, announcing from the rooftops its revolutionary potential for change.

\
Yet while classical Bauhasian Industrial and Graphic arts made manufactured goods accessible, and User Experience Design made computers socially  ubiquitous, it seems quite clear that beyond petty gimmicks masquerading as innovation, the buck clearly has decided to stop here.The establishment’s favourite child of  Design Thinking and its large promises to transform the world and terraform our lives forever has fallen flat, from IDEO’s failure to transform the town of Gainesville via their celebratory patented method, to their eventual shutting down of three of their global offices in 2021, to gimmicks like Jule’s and Drinkfinity, it seems to show us that design thinking’s insistence on the ability of anyone to solve any problem no matter how difficult it is via their signature process  is starting to crack in the face of cold harsh reality. 



Design and its dogma can create objects of delight, whether those be cute coffee tables, posters for your favourite band and the next addictive fintech platform that allows people to spend money they don’t have. Design academics will digress, pointing out the many amazing things being showcased at contests, conferences and exhibitions around the world that apparently have solved our greatest problems. Yet despite this, we barely see any of these solutions be implemented in the real world, and even when in the rare case that they are, they simply do not make the sustained social change or ripple in the pond that designers say they do. Design has made our lives delightful and has made things usable. But the emphasis of the individual (“user”) has made the design discipline the origin of some truly evil problems, such as the product designers at Facebook inadvertently creating a political crisis and undermining democratic processes in the 2016 cambridge analytica scandal, to the design founders of Airbnb being directly responsible for gentrification in many major cities leaving little to no room for affordable housing for the shrinking middle class. And we haven’t even really gotten started yet

Climate Change, Political polarization, alienating social anomie and growing  economic instability are all examples of some of humanity’s greatest problems concerning  general systems collapse, one for which Design’s most celebrated titans, design theorist Horst Rittel anointed a term: Wicked problems. Wicked Problems are the multi-headed hydra that corrodes every tenet of design thinking to nothing. As described by Rittel and Webber, wicked problems have 10 important characteristics:

**1) They do not have a definitive formulation.**

**2)  They do not have a “stopping rule.”** In other words, these problems lack an inherent logic that signals when they are solved.

**3**)  Their solutions are not true or false, **only good or bad.**

**4)  There is no way to test the solution to a wicked problem.**

**5)  They cannot be studied through trial and error.** Their solutions are irreversible so, as Rittel and Webber put it, “every trial counts.”

**6) There is no end to the number of solutions or approaches to a wicked problem.**

**7) All wicked problems are essentially unique, undermining the value of previous research**

**8) Wicked problems can always be described as the symptom of other problems.** They are Kyriarchical in their nature, their causes reducible to many complex highly interrelated factors

**9) The way a wicked problem is described determines its possible solutions.**

**10) Planners, that is those who present solutions to these problems, have no right to be wrong.** Unlike mathematicians, “planners are liable for the consequences of the solutions they generate; the effects can matter a great deal to the people who are touched by those actions.”

Rittel’s text was meant to showcase that the inherent complexity of Wicked Problems simply meant that linear processes were not only insufficient, they were functionally useless at solving them. The “wickedness” of wicked problems refers not to any moral judgement, but instead to how brutally they push back, persist and reform.  To sprinkle salt on tired wounds, these characteristics directly dissolve the entire design thinking process until it is nothing more than mere platitude. Even Empathy as a tenet of the design process is something that titans such as Don Norman have a bone to pick with, effectively making it hollow. Robert Sutton, the cofounder of the Stanford D.School has said, “design thinking” is often treated “more like a religion than a set of practices for sparking creativity”

And yet the design world persists in delusion, living in a world gone by. Design veterans believe that merely integrating some koans of systems thinking and mere acknowledgement of the interdependence of problems can help make up for Design’s obvious lack. It does not. Merely packaging design thinking with new words such as “transition design”, “planet centric  design” and “humanity centred design” does showcase pure intent, but is still  far from a viable solution, especially with the silence that accompanies the answer as to what tools will help us bring about this ambitious vision. Design, as it remains, is still insufficient.



We also see the rise of new tools, trends and problems that academics in their ivory towers are willfully ignorant of. The world is now a very fast changing place, and it has no time for long drawn out research phases predicated on the basis of short term myopia (hence the integration into the Agile Waterfall). New trends, tools and technologies have emerged, shredding and shaking up established industries like they were nothing. The rise of interconnected sensor environments, Immersive media technologies, new instruments of affordances, realtime network systems and a globalised connected culture with unique differences require that design must let go of blind arrogance that it knows and return to a place where it simply does not know. Design academics speak with confidence over their integration of artificial intelligence with design, while people in the know realise that it is clearly eyewash meant to fool amateurs.



Design, as it is, largely came from an  western, now largely American dialectic, one that preaches the Judeochristian dominion of Mankind over nature,  the Baconian universe is something to exploit and extract, that the world if it is understood can be controlled to give us what we want, that Descartian notion that Mind is above matter and the neoliberal enlightenment fixation that Individuals come above communities. Yet the problems that the world faces today simply does NOT afford us, the generation that will be required to step up and tackle it, the convenience of listening to demagogues who insist on the efficacy of their stone age wheelbarrows.



Design needs to make use of Big Data that drives business and maps complex systems. **It does not.**

\
Design needs to actively  use machine intelligence in Human+computer processes. **It does not**  and has relegated AI to a gimmicky assistant butler

Design needs agility, and it needs to come up to speed with how fast the world moves in economic and technological cycles of change.  **It does not**

Design needs to see to it that consumers have the ability to create their own tools and systems. **Design still operates from the white messiah saviour complex and so does not afford participation in articulating final design outcomes**

Design needs to speak the language of art, science and technology and build in said languages. **Design as it is  likes to sit on its backside proclaiming from the rooftops that the 6 step process is enough when it demonstrably isn't**

Finally, Design needs to move from privileged Bourgeoisie notions of egoistic “empathy” that simply, 9/10 times results in the creation of artefacts benefiting the 1% and widening the gap between haves and have nots. **Design is not Of, By or For the people in its public image, its active processes and its most significant artefacts, no matter how much it claims to be otherwise.** To be a designer and to be designed for is the privilege of the most privileged members of society

Design, as it stands, makes radically innovative concepts usable, **but in and of itself isn't radically innovative by any means.** 

\
Finally, ***Indian Design as an industry is nothing but the labour of a sepoy regiment still loyal to their colonial master**s.*** Indian on the surface as it may be, ***it is white through and through, all the way to the marrow of its bone,** *whether that be in worldview, practice, process or intended audience. Disappointedly but unsurprisingly, the past 20 years of design education in India has shown us that Indian design pedagogy is more concerned with magic shows, empty conferences and self-flagellation than any real worthwhile contribution to global discourse, cultural transfiguration or demonstrative social upliftment. ***Indian design as it stands today is not “Indian” in any sense of the word and is merely white thought brought to an Indian context*** demonstrating the origins of design sourced from the Indian 1% and having little to nothing in common with the bedrock of thought native to this country. The fact that this archaeology is locked behind ivory towers accessible to the privileged few, wholeheartedly disgusts my conscience, along with its smug satisfaction that being an ardent obedient follower is a matter of any sort of personal pride



It is neocolonial, privileged, ineffective, arrogant, outdated and above all, ***simply insufficient***

Indian Design, if it really does want to solve the world’s most pressing problems, must return to the beginner’s mind, start the journey from scratch, watch with open eyes as to what is happening in other fields, look back to its ancient thoughtforms and practices, and finally transcend itself in every sense of the word. 



*If design is to effectively use machine intelligence as a true co-pilot to its fullest extent in the design process,*

*If design is to truly navigate the wicked problems that threaten our future the most,*

*If design is truly meant to heal as well as fully empower people to their best and not plague them with rotten destructive consumerist addiction*

*If design is truly meant to be of, for and by people and their communities,*

*If design is truly meant to be radically innovative and create new futures,*

*And if Indian design is truly meant to be indigenous both in skin and marrow,*



Then we as current designers have no option but to grace our predecessors with the acknowledgement that while what they have taught us is indispensable,  it is our duty to our fellow human beings and the world that we must become something greater. We must let go of dogma, archaeology and attachment to something long past its due date of death. We must destroy the ivory temple of design, and rebuild it from the ground up. 



**Design must use AI,** where machine intelligence is used to its fullest extent in the right way and exponentially augments the capabilities of human designers.

**Design must use Data**, making full use of the vast ecosystems of analytic metrics available to us today. This will help us truly understand systems at scal

**Design must face new medi**a , fully acknowledging their computational properties and thus designing for emerging media technology such as IOT, XR, sound and neural interfaces.

**Design must face complexity,** understanding the tenets of networks, fractals, scaling and game theory in order to solve problems for systems involving more than a single individual and a variety of unpredictable yet important factors

**Design must solve wicked problems**, where objectives, parameters and constraints are multifaceted, complex, incomplete, adaptive and contradictory. Design must be ready to fight the world’s hardest problems such as climate change, democratic backsliding, social alienation and a highly networked world

**Design must be radically innovative**, understanding that innovation is often a bottom-up playful and creative process that is hard to quantify yet critically essential in this new dynamic landscape, aptly termed a “wicked learning environment

**Design must be both open-source as well as participatory**, Where people from all walks of life have a major say in the solution that affects them instead of being relegated to being test subject guinea pigs. Design can no longer tie its back behind the artistic cultism of originality. Instead, the designer must work as a collaborator and build his own tools that connect with a wide variety of others

**Design must be Indigenou**s, unafraid to stand out and stand tall against white hegemony. Design must be decolonized, in order to truly embrace and utilise unique cultural strengths in the face of the world’s most pressing problems breaking down the pillars of the enlightenment

**Design must heal the world with true humanistic values**, designing radical solutions that benefit as many people as possible and compassionately attempt to heal suffering, instead of being a bystander empath that capitalises on the unfortunate to make the rich richer

***Above all, Design must return to the beginner’s mind:*** Opening itself up to new approaches, practices and thoughtforms, whether they be from the arts or sciences, modern or ancient, familiar or alien. Design must be open-minded with an attitude of radical curiosity, lest it be left in the dust as a discipline of a distant past.



Fortunately, not only  is this completely possible right now, it is unavoidably  imminent in our near future. It is up to us, those in between eras, to seize this historical moment. 



#### Towards a Cosmic Future

For years, computational design has been proclaimed to be the next transitory phase of design in a post design thinking world, having long been used in the spaces of chip design, circuit design, game design and urban modelling . Generative design tools such as Grasshopper 3d use a combination of complexity theory topics such as agent systems, swarm logic and system attractors to design for adaptive city scale networks, and sustainable architecture has long been regarded as a wicked problem. Computational designers have long since used evolutionary design processes, a process by which machine intelligence models create pocket universes informed by Building Information Modelling (BIM) data that designers guide towards a final optimized outcome, exploring a 1000 iterations at once.

This is the new designer, a human+computer cybernetic system. Like how Chess Grandmaster Gary Kasparov found out post his loss to IBM’s Deep Blue that Human+AI systems could beat both Grandmasters as well as AI, the designer of the future uses machine intelligence systems to vastly expand the potential abilities of the design discipline, one that can only be said to be cosmic in nature

These tools are tightly coupled and can trade information with other new media software such as Unreal engine, touchdesigner and Stable Diffusion, software that use node-based workflows and parametric models to design custom design solutions optimized to constraints and parameters for a combination of sensor based realtime applications as well as immersive media. Even more convenient is the fact that many of the tenets of complexity theory have long been acknowledged to be more in common with eastern philosophies such as those of Indian philosophy, whose strangely transient, computational, generative and networked modes of perception are such a well fit, it's scary to see how it can be more than a coincidence. Indian philosophy is not just a viable fit for this emerging media based design, it’s a perfect fit, one which sidesteps the neoliberal nonsense that got us into , as David Schmatenberg would put it, a complex multipolar meta-crisis.



Let me be clear. I don’t know if this is the true answer or not. This could very much end up being a gimmick. But in the case that it’s not, then what we seem to realize is that a new form of true Indian design built on the bedrock of ArtScience,cybernetics,  Indian philosophy, Parametric thinking, New Media, Immersive environments, deep learning concepts and complexity science ***is not only real, near and viable, but is necessary***

We  must seize our future, lest it slip ever far away from these hands that reach out to the sun

We will create a new future with our own hands, building new processes, habits, concepts, workflows and systems in order to truly create a future owed to all entities of planet Earth, both human and nonhuman. 

As the saying goes, *vasudhaivam kutumbakam*: The world is one, so we owe it both our integrity as well as indomitability.
