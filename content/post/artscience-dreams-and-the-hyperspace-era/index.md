CP Snow's profound essay, "two cultures", begins with the lamentation of a great divide between two of society's most important frontiers: That of the arts and the sciences. Snow himself was on the fence, being both an english novelist and a physical chemist, and therefore his essay was a personal evocation of his frustrations with this divide, a divide whose reality he did not recognize. Of course, the skeptic would recognize this as academic babble. "Here goes another lecture on the trAnsDisciPlinarY poTenTial of an intersection between art and science". Most of the time this would be scientists and STEM professionals, and they can't be blamed since we are a part of a global culture whose gears are increasingly following the lead of the Science and Technology.

However, rather than writing the academic equivalent of napkin paper filled with obscure terminologies, I'm going to try and argue why I think there is real potential in ArtScience as a discipline, and how I personally understand it.

## Synergy between Art and Science

If there is potential for the arts to be influenced by science, there is definitely a lot of strong examples for it. Artist residencies have been a thing for ages, and have occurred in historic centres such as XEROX-PARC, the place where a computer GUI was first prototyped. Scores of artists have been significantly influenced by the sciences, from popular director Christopher Nolan to the beloved painter Wassily Kandinsky, whose practice was, as he quotes, "to enter the arts with the riguour of the scientific method". Many more artists such as M.C Escher and Ernst Haeckel would directly develop their style from STEM influence, often referencing scientific research papers for artistic inspiration. 

But now the question reverses: Can the arts influences the sciences? 

While the STEM skeptic may repeatedly ask this question, understanding that while an artist may go to a scientific lab and gain artistic inspiration, it seems inconceivable for a scientist to go into a painter's studio and develop new scientific theories from watching paint dry. And yet examples of Scientists who us artistic approaches abound. The most important of these is the late Anthropologist Gregory Bateson who wrote the Book, *Steps to an ecology of Mind.* Bateson quoted himself as "one who seeks to invade the sciences with the attitude of an artist" in his book *Mind and Nature,* and his work was central to the original Macy's conferences, which later became the bedrock and the field of cybernetics and subsequently the computer revolution.

And while it may not be necessarily possible for a scientist to gain experience of scientific possibilities while in a painters studio, the role an artist can play is so much more. Science and technology, according to multiple philosophers like Stiegler and Heidegger, enter into mutually symbiotic relationships, where scientific discovery is very dependent on tools and metaphors. In this sense, there is historical evidence for scientists using tools and metaphors created by the arts, most prominently with the art of japanese paper folding called **origami** *.* In the documentary *Between the folds*, a case is made for how multiple domains in STEM such as science, math and design now apply knowledge extracted from the practice of Origami to multiple STEM domains, ranging from biology's difficulties with protein folding to new material folding structures in rocket-ships.  A more recent example would be how researchers used Stable diffusion to read and reconstruct images from MRI signals. Thus,  a variety of artistic tools and metaphors provide new ground for a variety of STEM applications. 

To quote from *Between the folds:*

> *Often in the sciences, things that are built for aesthetic or fun reasons will find unexpected use in technical sciences and application*

I think more crucially, artists can help put up a roadblock in front of  the dangerous attitude of "science for science's sake". Artists have no subjective attachement to a quest ofor truth and instead are primarily concerned with the construction of beauty and meaning. Thus, artist's can use scientific discovery to point out discilpinary biases and dangerous mindsets, especially in these days when Science establishes itself as the vanguard of Objecivity when Thomas clearly outlines how that isn't the case in *The structure for Scientific revolutions*, underpinning how scientists like all human beings can be tribalistic and dogmatic about their beliefs and traditions.

## The artifacts of an ArtScience approach

But now a question arises. These interdisciplinary collaborations are not necessarily anything called "artscience". In any case, the output is either art or science and nothing that applies to both. So we must ask, can something be both art and science? or:

Can something encompass both an expression of meaning and scientific explanation for phenomena? ***Can something have both elegance of function and functional elegance?***

The answer to that question is also "yes". The most obvious example of this would be Fractals, those mathematical patterns that self replicate at every scale. Fractals possess both the ability to qualify as real art as well as real science, despite originating from Benoit Mandelbroit, an economist. While there are scientific tools such as Walrus and Gephi whose graphs qualify as art, there's also Kolams, whose fractal patterns are studied by scientists and can qualify as science as well.

Thus there is real possibility for artifacts to represent both art and science and exist at that intersection. Although that field is still nascently explored, it is still demonstrative of a real consequence.

## ArtScience's Indian roots and its implications

In Wendy Doniger's book "Dreams, iillusions and other realities", she extrapolates that in ancient indian thought, artistic endeavour and scientific enterprise are more or less the same thing: The individual discovering a structure within the contents of his own mind. Like Jung postulates in "man and his symbols", the contents of one's mind may reform to mimic the structure of an external reality, much like how a computer can run a fluid simulation or a simulation of a car hitting a wall with accurate physics  even though there is no physical fluid or car inside said computer.

Almost the whole philosophy of Indian art is contained in the verse of Sukrâcârya’s *Sukranitisàra* which enjoins this method of visualisation upon the imager:

> *In order that the form of an image may be brought fully and clearly before the mind, the image maker should meditate; and his success will be in proportion to his meditation. No other way—not indeed seeing the object itself—will achieve his purpose.*

This lies in stark contrast to Western implications of artistic "ownership". While the Indian artist may get credit for "discovering" a structure in the contents of his mind or in the possbilities afforded by a tradition (such as the raga system), he is ***not the origin*** of said artwork, much like how a child comes through his parents, not from them. 

A lot of this tends to be due to Indian cosmology, where the "real world" is simply a consequence of Vishnu's dreaming in his deep slumber. Like how a dreamer finds a symbol in his dream and looks for it in the real world, both the artist and the scientist look for a connection between the inner and outer worlds they inhabit. Dreams themselves have often been a source of inspiration to both artists as well as scientists, from Kekule's formulating the chemical structure of Benzene via witnessing the ourobourous swirling  in his mind, to Gauss and Poincare formulating theorems after witnessing  take shape in their brain, to most famously Salvador Dali drawing inspiration from his dreams to produce his surrealist imagery.

Thus at the core of at least and Indian interpretation of ArtScience, we draw attention to the origin of the word "invent", i.e the Latin term "inveniere" which means "To find something by seeking it". During the renaissance, the archetype of the inventor was the joint hip of the Renaissance man, a figure who demonstrated extreme capability in both the arts and the sciences. Thus, it is probably this archetype that provides the greatest insight towards a method we can call "artScience"

## Hackers, Tinkers and Non-Linear relationships:

In "The philosophy of simulation", Delanda brings up the idea of how emergence can occur and be simulated to close similarity in both a computer and the real world, and to do this, he uses the concept of a "phase space". 

In dynamical systems theory and control theory, a phase space or state space is a space in which all possible "states" of a dynamical system or a control system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space.

A phase space is , mathematically speaking, hyperspace, that place beyond our usual 3 dimensions which can collapse to give specific form. Origami is a great example of phase space, where a 2d plane can either be crumpled to give a 3d ball or be meticulously assembled to create a paper crane. A better demonstration of this is AI art, where the "phase space" or latent space of all prompt points condense into a singular image (massive oversimplification but roughly this is what happens). Think of it like a multicoloured set of gases in a box which can condense at any time to give different, rainbow like crystals.

The real world and the computer are both phase spaces comprising nonlinear relationships. Delanda argues then that if both spaces have a similar process of condensation, then one space can "simulate" another. But then, we can also apply this "phase space" concept to the our own brains, where we can directly simulate aspects of reality through our ability to imagine things. 

Now for the artscientist to create forms from these raw materials, it would be smart to use the powers of imagination to create an idea in one's head, and then to make that a reality through mindlessly tinkering. By tinkering, one can exploit the hidden networked relationships in a material, allowing it to reform and recreate multiple possibilties. Examples of this "tinker"approach include orgiami's development by master Yoshizawa, Benoit's "Fractals: Form, chance and orde"r and the early progenesis of the field of cybernetics, where the proponents simply started making without any direct aim in mind, which we can calll "fuck around and find out". Of course, this cannot happen in the ivory tours of academia which are more concerned with the approval afforded by fellow peer reviews than any actual innovation.

## Conclusion

To conclude, there is a possbility for an infinite number disciplines emerging out the grey space between established ideas of Art and Science respectively, and most of this may lie in the responsibility of the "toolmaker". This toolmaker individual may create tools that offers potential to both artistic and scientific enquiry. To me, this effort is best directed at Citizen Science and Participatory art, where the public can intervene.

Of course, there is real danger in misapplication. We are currently in the midst of an anti-intellectual era, one that oversimplifies archaic science for political agendas, as well as the misappropriation of science to justifiy dogmatic religious beliefs and pseudoscientific endeavours. Artists must take care that their art contributes to greater scientific literacy in the general public. 

Likewise, Science must not dismiss its role in the hasty formulations of metaphors, because it is such metaphors that lead to poltical dogma. Metaphors such as "survival of the fittest" and "the selfish gene" have been used to justify outdated economic models based on Hobbesian theories, despite the fact that this interpretation of evolution has long outlived its use and evolution is now looking at a "web" of life and epigenetics. In this way, artists can help promote updated models of science that is accessible and understandable to the general public.

Finally, in the Indian context, Artscience can most definitely help solve the "problem of functionalism". India as country has had to take monumental effort to restore the basic needs of people, and to fulfill these needs there is a still a long way to go. At the same time, Art represents economic Soft-Power, and the neglect of artistic spirit will lead to an ugly place no one will want to be a part of. Through Artscience, we can bypass the common Indian complaint that many Indian artist receives: "what use does this have?". Through an incorporated functional approach, artscience has the capacity to create a greater public awareness of and value for art.
