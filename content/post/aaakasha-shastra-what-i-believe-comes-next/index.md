After four years of my studies at Srishti, and with less than two months left for my graduation, the time obviously comes for every undergraduate student to answer a very critical question:

What do you plan on doing after college? 

For some, this may be getting that bag and sitting on a pile of gold.

For some, this may be climbing the corporate ladder of a prestigious company. 

For some, this may be giving up on the subject of their undergraduate degree altogether.

All these paths, to me, are equally valid. There is nothing wrong with any of these directions.

To me however, the past 5 years have only instilled in me a deep sense of dissatisfaction, and an even deeper sense of curiosity. Many years of talking, doing, making, both succeeding and failing, both teaching and learning, from the many people I've met along the road as well as my own mysterious nature as a person, have led me to the conclusion that there are many things in this world that need to be answered, and many fuzzy, barely perceptible things need to be brought to the surface. There are two gaps to be bridged. One, the gap between what the world needs and what we are capable of doing to address those needs, and Two, My desires as a person and my capacity to act and fulfill those desires.

Obviously, the nature of what I intend to accomplish with my career as a project may span many, many years, with no end in sight. It may require a tenacity, work ethic, resilience and perseverance that I may not possess. Yet, a whisper still rings in my heart, that I believe- nay, what I have faith in- must be accomplished, even if it is imperfect. I may succeed or fail, but it has to be outlined, demarcated, expressed, even in its roughest form.

So, what are my larger goals? What exactly are the grand ambitions of this clueless, broke armchair-philosopher 23 year old? I've written this to clarify what my field and intentions are, so as to dispel any confusion.

## New needs, New developments

What we call design methodology in its current form, precedes a lot of important trends. Don Norman's *Design of everyday things* was published in 1985 and was originally called the *Psychology of everyday things.* Tim brown's *Design thinking* method that he formulated in the very early 2000's is what most of us have come to recognize as the standard design thinking process. While to many these methods remain sufficient,we are missing certain critical nuances. A lot of important trends have taken place that design, as a field, really hasn't responded to very well. I'll outline some of them below.

#### **The increasing power, affordability and ubiquity of chips and sensors**

![](v7sj89c8emq91.jpg "The top left hard drive is probably 120 mb, and the micro sd card to the bottom right is probably around 16 gb. ")

The above image showcases the development of storage devices over 45 years. What we can directly infer from this evolution is that personal storage is getting smaller, more dense and more mobile. The factors that have driven this growth is something called "moore's law", which states that *that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years*. What this results in, is something futurist Ray Kurzweil called the "law of accelerating returns.

![](1688887152091.png "How computers improve exponentially over the years")

The law basically states that far from being a straightforward line of improvement, accelerating returns means that every year, the improvement effectively doubles. What we're seeing happening overall is imperceptible yet significant. Computer chips and sensors are getting smaller, cheaper, smarter, more common and ever more powerful with each passing year. This is why it's also hard to pinpoint the potential of new paradigms as and when they arrive. In 2023, sensors are the language that drives industry, and the amount of data they capture is enormous. We now have affordable sensors for nearly everything, from biosignals to weather instrumentation. And these capabilities only grow further.

#### **The nature, potential and evolution of personal computing systems**

![](images.jpg "The apple watch can now read your heartbeat systems")

A critical fact to consider is that computers are no longer the devices they were back then, 40 years ago. As computers evolve, they move along multiple significant lines of change:

* Increasing imperceptibility (computing becomes harder to actively notice i.e invisible )
* Increasing Ubiquity (computing eats into more places that didn't require computing prior)
* Decreasing latency (computers process more faster, now almost instantaneously )
* Increasing intelligence (computers are getting "smarter" at responding to humans)
* Increasing affordance (computers are capable of doing more with their sensors and motors )
* Increasing integration (computers are becoming more tightly coupled with their users)

Computers are probably going to move in this historical trajectory

Industrial ( Early days of US millitary) ->

\->  Personal (Apple Macintosh)  ->

\-> Mobile (Iphone) -> Wearable (smar

\-> Wearable (smartwatches) ->

\-> Spatial (XR headsets) -> Imperceptible, a Doomer scenario where its all [computronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium) (well, [not exactly](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/radical-atoms/))

![](untitled.png "Biofeedback is now a critical computer ability ")

\
These trends build the now commonplace principle of "biofeedback", where human responses are dynamically managed and coordinated with or by computational systems. This can be used for good (apple watches saving people dying of heart attacks) or bad (Reel addiction via Product designer Nir Eyal's *[Hook-cycle](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/)).* The computer now becomes a cybernetic extension of people's sensory systems, making the Mcluhan quote turn from metaphor into literal reality. 

What we are actively seeing happen is the transformation of computer from inert static machines (like wheels and steam engines) to something more akin to a *living organism*. Even the ability of computer programs to accommodate plugins, mods, skins and add-ons looks less like pencil sharpener and more like a living creature performing  *endosymbiosis,* the ability to ***evolve using external entities.*** MIT Media Lab alumni and Computational designer John Maeda explicitly states as much in his book " How to speak machine", declaring that in a very primitive way, machines are effectively complex adaptive systems with much more in common with living creatures.

![](endosymbiosis_med.jpeg "The modular nature of computers looks more like a permeable cell than an impermeable chemical")

The problem then becomes clearer that current design models are derivative of the mother disciplines of industrial and graphic design, both themselves representative of a top down approach that is great at dealing with inert objects but struggles with the complexity of living creatures. The implication is that after a certain threshold is reached, the physical model that we have used for design will have to eventually give way due to being insufficient.

It's safe to say that current design methodology is good enough, but doesn't really make complete use of what computers *really* are and what they eventually will become.
