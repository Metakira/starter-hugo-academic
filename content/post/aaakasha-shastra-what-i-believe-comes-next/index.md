After four years of my studies at Srishti, and with less than two months left for my graduation, the time obviously comes for every undergraduate student to answer a very critical question:

What do you plan on doing after college? 

For some, this may be getting that bag and sitting on a pile of gold.

For some, this may be climbing the corporate ladder of a prestigious company. 

For some, this may be giving up on the subject of their undergraduate degree altogether.

All these paths, to me, are equally valid. There is nothing wrong with any of these directions.

To me however, the past 5 years have only instilled in me a deep sense of dissatisfaction, and an even deeper sense of curiosity. Many years of talking, doing, making, both succeeding and failing, both teaching and learning, from the many people I've met along the journey as well as my own nature as a person, have led me to the conclusion that there are many things in this world that need to be answered, and many fuzzy, barely perceptible things need to be brought to light. 

As I see it, there are two gaps to be bridged. 

One, the gap between what the world needs and what we are capable of doing to address those needs, and Two, my desires as a person and my capacity to act on and fulfill those desires.

Obviously, the nature of what I intend to accomplish with my career as a project may span many, many years, with no end in sight. It may require a tenacity, work ethic, resilience and perseverance that I may not possess. Yet, a whisper still rings in my heart, that what I believe -nay, what I have faith in- must be accomplished, even if it is imperfect. I may succeed or fail, but it has to be outlined, demarcated, expressed, even in its roughest impure form.

So, what are my larger goals? What exactly are the grand ambitions of this clueless, broke armchair-philosopher 23 year old? I've written this to clarify what my field and intentions are, so as to dispel any confusion.

# New needs, New developments

What we call design methodology in its current form, precedes a lot of important trends. Don Norman's *Design of everyday things* was published in 1985 and was originally called the *Psychology of everyday things.* Tim brown's *Design thinking* method that he formulated in the very early 2000's is what most of us have come to recognize as the standard design thinking process. While to many these methods remain sufficient,we are missing certain critical nuances. 

A lot of important trends have taken place that design, as a field, really hasn't responded to very well. I'll outline some of them below.

#### **The increasing power, affordability and ubiquity of chips and sensors**

![](v7sj89c8emq91.jpg "The top left hard drive is probably 120 mb, and the micro sd card to the bottom right is probably around 16 gb. ")

The above image showcases the development of storage devices over 45 years. What we can directly infer from this evolution is that personal storage is getting smaller, more dense and more mobile. The factors that have driven this growth is something called "moore's law", which states that *that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years*. What this results in, is something futurist Ray Kurzweil called the "law of accelerating returns.

![](1688887152091.png "How computers improve exponentially over the years")

The law basically states that far from being a straightforward line of improvement, accelerating returns means that every year, the improvement effectively doubles. What we're seeing happening overall is imperceptible yet significant. Computer chips and sensors are getting smaller, cheaper, smarter, more common and ever more powerful with each passing year. This is why it's also hard to pinpoint the potential of new paradigms as and when they arrive. In 2023, sensors are the gears that drives the industrial complex overall, and the amount of data they capture is enormous. We now have affordable sensors for nearly everything, from biosignals to weather instrumentation. And these capabilities only grow further.

#### **The nature, potential and evolution of personal computing systems**

![](images.jpg "The apple watch can now read your heartbeat signals")

A critical fact to consider is that computers are no longer the devices they were back then, 40 years ago. As computers evolve, they move along multiple significant lines of change:

* Increasing imperceptibility (computing becomes harder to actively notice i.e invisible )
* Increasing Ubiquity (computing eats into more places that didn't require computing prior)
* Decreasing latency (computers process more things faster)
* Increasing intelligence (computers are getting "smarter" at responding to humans)
* Increasing affordance (computers are capable of doing more and more things)
* Increasing integration (computers are becoming more tightly coupled with their users)
* Increasing ability to simulate (Computers have the ability to mimic the dynamics of any system)

Computers are probably going to move in this historical trajectory

Industrial ( Early days of US millitary) ->

\->  Personal (Apple Macintosh)  ->

\-> Mobile (Iphone) -> Wearable (smar

\-> Wearable (smartwatches) ->

\-> Spatial (XR headsets) -> Imperceptible, a Doomer scenario where its all [computronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium) (well, [not exactly](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/radical-atoms/))

![](untitled.png "Biofeedback is now a powerful computational capability")

\
These trends build the now commonplace principle of "biofeedback", where human responses are dynamically managed and coordinated with or by computational systems. This can be used for good (apple watches saving people dying of heart attacks) or bad (Reel addiction via Product designer Nir Eyal's *[Hook-cycle](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/)).* The computer now becomes a cybernetic extension of people's sensory systems, making the Mcluhan quote turn from metaphor into literal reality. 

What we are actively seeing happen is the transformation of computers from inert static machines (like wheels and steam engines) to something more akin to a *living organism*. Even the ability of computer programs to accommodate plugins, mods, skins and add-ons looks less like pencil sharpener and more like a living creature performing  *endosymbiosis,* the ability to ***evolve using external entities.*** MIT Media Lab alumni and Computational designer John Maeda explicitly states as much in his book " How to speak machine", declaring that in a very primitive way, machines are effectively complex adaptive systems with much more in common with living creatures.

![](endosymbiosis_med.jpeg "The modular nature of computers looks more like a permeable cell than an impermeable chemical")

The problem then becomes clearer that current design models are derivative of the mother disciplines of industrial and graphic design, both themselves representative of a top down approach that is great at dealing with inert objects but struggles with the complexity of living creatures. The implication is that after a certain threshold is reached, the physical model that we have used for design will have to eventually give way due to being insufficient.

It's safe to say that current design methodology is good enough, but doesn't really make complete use of what computers *really* are and what they eventually will become.  As a wise (disgraced) man once said:

> <!--StartFragment-->

> “ Design has also evolved from the design of objects, both physical and material, to the design of systems, to the design of complex adaptive systems. This evolution is shifting the role of designers; they are no longer the central planners, but participants within the systems in which they work. This is a fundamental shift- ***one that requires a new set of values***”

#### **The emergence and evolution of the Internet (Metcalfe's law)**

![](metcalfe2.png "As more nodes get connected, the network , past a critical mass, acquires newfound properties")

![](metcalfe1.png "How the Internet EXPLODED")

The internet really started taking off in 1998, and when it arrived, no one at the time really knew what it really could become. Now, the internet literally drives the entire planet forward, with internet culture evolving from being a small part of the mainstream to both becoming as well as **defining**  the mainstream. And now with the [spatial web](https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45) (  a combination of XR and IOT being connected as one giant system ), we see that the network dynamics of the internet will probably explode beyond what we know of it as of today. 

Yet despite the emergent properties of network effects defining design problems of today ( Facebook's engagement system eventually becoming a reason for driving political polarisation) , we still see little to no discussion of networks and their qualities. The idea of emergence, despite its overreaching and far felt effects today, is practically ignored in mainstream design discourse. All current design models were developed before the complete emergence of the internet's "critical mass" and its ability to connect people globally. 

#### **Big Data and Big business (Late-stage capitalist realism):**

![](asd.png "Eye of a Digital Sauron")

"Big Data" refers to large data sets that are too large and too wide to encompass, and thus require specialized techniques to parse through effectively. And in our current day and age populated by invisible surveillance systems that generate entire pools of information, big data drives big business. Almost every business on eart relies on some form of analytics to survive, and the biggest companies use their data collection system as competitive leverage. The power and pull of big data is so great, "data driven design" is starting to become a motif within industry trends. Large datasets have the ability to predict changes that regular people are incapable of, which is why many companies have shifted to a purely quantitative approach of analyzing customers.

Now we may say that design is a great defense mechanism against the scary clutches of big business's watchful eye, but the truth is that empathetic research may not necessarily bear fruit as an empathetic solution. The pull of Business and capital are starting to morph design away from its origins, with UX turning into product design, industry stalwarts like Jakob Nielson telling designers to "do away with inclusivity" and "to think in dollar signs" as well as the establishment of nefarious practices such as ***dark patterns.***

Fighting against data is pointless, and designers will be on a losing streak if we continuously rub shoudlers against the power (and dangers) of data. In fact when we look at the evolution of design as a practice, we can notice three major trends:

1. Design outcomes become more "abstract"
2. Design increasingly divorces itself  from its craft-based Bauhausian roots
3. Design approaches problems of increasing scale
4. The outcomes stay in "place" for longer and are more spatial

For example:

 (Industrial, Graphic design) ->( User Experience Design ) -> (Service/System/Strategic design) -> ??

Capitalism's influence on design outcomes will always stay, and businesses do not care for things like empathy and improving people's lives. As design itself moves from the scale of communal to international and even planetary scope, the use of data to determine large-scale behaviour will soon prove necessary whether we like it or not. At the same time, we need to be mindful of capitalism's increasing chokehold on design, and how design itself, if not managed and guided properly, can exacerbate the devastating effects of late stage capitalism's descent into self-destruction (inevitably taking us along with it). 

The eye of capitalism becomes ever more determining of reality, and if we look close enough, American capitalism, through the large scale societal outcomes manufactured by dark design patterns,  is turning culture itself into one giant[ Casino machine](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024).

#### **Generative AI and Synthetic Media**

![](1_wbv7o_fkwmiboshqf2pt7q-1024x640.png "A deepfake example")

A strange kind of hubris is developing in the design community, one which repeatedly maintains the following:

" AI is just a tool, it cannot replace us, the design process will largely remain the same"

Let's look at what AI is capable of doing:

* *Go*, an ancient Chinese game thought to be so complex it was a human only task. [AlphaGo by Google beat Grandmaster sedol in 2016, by using moves never played before in 1000 years history of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)
* *Bridge*, a card game that requires strategy of reading human facial expressions as opposed to the rough computation of chess and Go. Even Bill gates didn't think this was possible, but in 2022 [an AI model beat 8 of the world's best bridge players in a roundtable match](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/29/artificial-intelligence-beats-eight-world-champions-at-bridge&ved=2ahUKEwiMr4TY0qOFAxWecGwGHabKDNsQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1Y5rGsJCaeeMJA9pgUW0gv)
* [DeepMind solved the protein unfolding problem](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/30/1012712/deepmind-protein-folding-ai-solved-biology-science-drugs-disease/), a task that stumped human biotechnologists for the past 50 years. DeepMind is also discovering [new nanomaterial configurations ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://phys.org/news/2023-11-google-deepmind-compounds-open-access-database.html&ved=2ahUKEwihnsWp0qOFAxWnXGwGHQT5DCEQFnoECA4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw0H3mDpo9xuhhd8mARrso0Y)that humans could not.
* AI is capable of translating complex languages like Chinese in real-time. For the record, Chinese is difficult not just because of the 1000 characters, but also due to the contextual intonation, cultural specifics etc involved. It's the hardest Language out there by a long shot and it's a breeze to AI.
* AI can [translate and map Whale calls](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.wired.com/story/use-ai-talk-to-whales-save-life-on-earth/&ved=2ahUKEwjK_qzF0qOFAxV0xTgGHQmCAaMQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0GcHAU3qrjO5bZUHbLlGfH)

In his 2019 SXSW ( a leading design conference) talk, designer Stephen Anderson outlines the following slide:

![](genai.png)

The slide is interesting because in the wake of generative AI, the above equation does ring doubly true. Put realtime data analytics, an already existing design system such as Material design and the newfound powers of LLM's and Machine learning, and what you can see happening is that businesses will soon be able to automatically generate designs, much like how figma and midjourney are capable of synthetically generating graphic design. 

Synthetic media is fast, it's powerful, it has access to numbers you as a person don't, can perform many more iterations at a faster rate than you do and even if it isn't perfect, it's good enough for businesses to ship. This last sentence is more key because culture , due to Moore's law, is accelerating at previously little understood paces, and now any business that works with the power of the internet and computers has much much more to gain than the Bauhasian perfectionism of early design culture.

Take for example the current headset war between Apple and Meta. Apple spent years on the Vision pro, as early as 2016, and in the end, to much hype and glory, announced the arrival of "spatial computing". Meta on the other hand, ran into the ground headfirst with its hugely mocked "metaverse" and the little spoken of Quest 3. Yet Meta's approach, which decided to go open source and imperfect as long as it hit the ground running, now came up with ***[the actual better product for its price](https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/quest-is-better-than-vision-pro-why-zuckerberg-rates-meta-vr-above-apples-101707914233437.html).*** [Many have now returned their "overpriced" Vision Pros'](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072792/apple-vision-pro-early-adopters-returns&ved=2ahUKEwi9mvb60KOFAxVBa2wGHUIrDlEQFnoECCAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2_-AYW93zIs4FLq9UeVvxP), and I believe Apple knew it, which is why they manufactured very few units of the same. Apple has understood , to some degree, that it's closed source perfectionist approach is starting to lose in business and leaving them in the dust, which is probably why it released its [Ferret LLM AI model as open-source on github.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.techopedia.com/apple-unveils-ferret-an-open-source-genai-for-vision-language-tasks&ved=2ahUKEwjXtOSd0aOFAxXfbmwGHQxjCx0QFnoECDAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1CmaAFdS4QxMLNgwXzeKr2)

In the age of rapid change, first and "good enough" shatters the perfectionism of design hubris, which is why designers are going to be in for a huge shock if they think companies will be open minded to month long research cycles and relatively small scale prototyping phases. AI is a threat, and design, despite the showboating, is clearly clueless as a discipline on how to effectively utilize it.

The dangers of synthetic media, however, are even more grim. For the first time in history, people's faces and voices can be separated from their body, and evidence can be cooked from straight up from nothing. Synthetic exacerbates the growing problem of a [post-truth society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth), where deception prevails, and truth imperceptible. However, tackling synthetic media in and of its own is still not an often talked about topic, despite this specific issue being the utmost priority to tackle for proponents of design justice.

# A need for a novel syncretism

![](what-is-this.png "A map of this space. What's at the center?")

Syncretism is defined as:

> <!--StartFragment-->
>
> "...... the practice of combining different beliefs and various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions"
>
> \-Wikipedia
>
> <!--EndFragment-->

So obviously I'm talking about building a new discipline in and of itself. But here's the deal. I don't think of myself as any guru or innovator or visionary, and I don't really need to be one in order to justify the need for a syncretism. The simple reason for a syncretism is that overall, I'm interested in a great many things, and yet its ***hard***  to put all of this in a box. Is it Computational design? Is it New Media? Is it creative tech? Music technology? My head really starts to hurt because ***all of these things are very closely related, yet none of them really have any overarching term.*** It's both all AND none of the above. So while I have said that this is the future of design (for my thesis), the truth is that this has nothing to do with design, technology, media, art, science, philosophy, and has everything to do with them as well. It's a fucking headache.

Sure we can try slapping on "media arts and sciences" but that still doesn't really fit or express what I am seeing in this diverse field of knowledge. All of the things in this map have it, but the entire field itself is not reducible to any single discipline. ***But whatever "it" is, it's here, it's important and I believe it's the future.***

The world is now increasingly complex, interconnected, changing. Both Wicked problems and Wicked learning environments abound, and both are forgiving. This is something design is trying to tackle, but due to its Bauhasian roots, its repeatedly failing to do so. What we need if we want to move further is:

* A perspective decolonized from [WEIRD roots](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html). We need this because the extractive principles formed by the Baconian origins of science work well with chemistry and physics, [but not with the complexity of organisms and ecology](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKPUZiWMNe-g&ved=2ahUKEwjkhYal2KOFAxUXRmwGHU5pCv8QtwJ6BAgFEAI&usg=AOvVaw2bjWJ4akp9K0bympRDY11U), which technology is starting to mimic
