After four years of my studies at Srishti, and with less than two months left for my graduation, the time obviously comes for every undergraduate student to answer a very critical question:

What do you plan on doing after college? 

For some, this may be getting that bag and sitting on a pile of gold.

For some, this may be climbing the corporate ladder of a prestigious company. 

For some, this may be giving up on the subject of their undergraduate degree altogether.

All these paths, to me, are equally valid. There is nothing wrong with any of these directions.

To me however, the past 5 years have only instilled in me a deep sense of dissatisfaction, and an even deeper sense of curiosity. Many years of talking, doing, making, both succeeding and failing, both teaching and learning, from the many people I've met along the road as well as my own mysterious nature as a person, have led me to the conclusion that there are many things in this world that need to be answered, and many fuzzy, barely perceptible things need to be brought to the surface. There are two gaps to be bridged. One, the gap between what the world needs and what we are capable of doing to address those needs, and Two, My desires as a person and my capacity to act and fulfill those desires.

Obviously, the nature of what I intend to accomplish with my career as a project may span many, many years, with no end in sight. It may require a tenacity, work ethic, resilience and perseverance that I may not possess. Yet, a whisper still rings in my heart, that I believe- nay, what I have faith in- must be accomplished, even if it is imperfect. I may succeed or fail, but it has to be outlined, demarcated, expressed, even in its roughest form.

So, what are my larger goals? What exactly are the grand ambitions of this clueless, broke armchair-philosopher 23 year old?

## 1.New needs, new developments, new grammars: A need for a novel syncretism.

*Syncretism* is roughly roughly defined as the following:
