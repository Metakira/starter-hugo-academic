After four years of my studies at Srishti, and with less than two months left for my graduation, the time obviously comes for every undergraduate student to answer a very critical question:

What do you plan on doing after college? 

For some, this may be getting that bag and sitting on a pile of gold.

For some, this may be climbing the corporate ladder of a prestigious company. 

For some, this may be giving up on the subject of their undergraduate degree altogether.

All these paths, to me, are equally valid. There is nothing wrong with any of these directions.

To me however, the past 5 years have only instilled in me a deep sense of dissatisfaction, and an even deeper sense of curiosity. Many years of talking, doing, making, both succeeding and failing, both teaching and learning, from the many people I've met along the road as well as my own mysterious nature as a person, have led me to the conclusion that there are many things in this world that need to be answered, and many fuzzy, barely perceptible things need to be brought to the surface. There are two gaps to be bridged. One, the gap between what the world needs and what we are capable of doing to address those needs, and Two, My desires as a person and my capacity to act and fulfill those desires.

Obviously, the nature of what I intend to accomplish with my career as a project may span many, many years, with no end in sight. It may require a tenacity, work ethic, resilience and perseverance that I may not possess. Yet, a whisper still rings in my heart, that I believe- nay, what I have faith in- must be accomplished, even if it is imperfect. I may succeed or fail, but it has to be outlined, demarcated, expressed, even in its roughest form.

So, what are my larger goals? What exactly are the grand ambitions of this clueless, broke armchair-philosopher 23 year old? I've written this to clarify what my field and intentions are, so as to dispel any confusion.

## New needs, New developments

What we call design methodology in its current form, precedes a lot of important trends. Don Norman's *Design of everyday things* was published in 1985 and was originally called the *Psychology of everyday things.* Tim brown's *Design thinking* method that he formulated in the very early 2000's is what most of us have come to recognize as the standard design thinking process. While to many these methods remain sufficient,we are missing certain critical nuances. A lot of important trends have taken place that design, as a field, really hasn't responded to very well. I'll outline some of them below.

#### **The increasing power, affordability and ubiquity of chips and sensors**

The above image showcases the development of storage devices over 45 years. What we can directly infer from this evolution is that personal storage is getting smaller, more dense and more mobile. The factors that have driven this growth is something called "moore's law", which states that *that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years*. What this results in, is something futurist Ray Kurzweil called the "law of accelerating returns.



**The nature, potential and evolution of personal computing systems**:

* **The emergence and evolution of the Internet (Metcalfe's law):**
* **Big Data and Big business (Late-stage capitalist realism):**
* **Generative AI and Machine learning** 

## A need for a novel syncretism
