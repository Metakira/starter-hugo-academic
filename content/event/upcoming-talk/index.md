I did a talk on the Indian roots of Generative Music on the 7th of January 2024 for the first ever edition of ADC in India. I covered some interesting topics pertaining to the past of Indian music and the 
future of computer music with some analogies to bridge the two seemingly disparate domains, providing some interesting trajectories for the future of Indigenous instrumentation. I had a lot of fun 
delivering this, although it was definitely one of the most nerve wracking things I've ever done in my life.
