Neural interfaces are a form of physical interface that uses the body's latent biosignals as a means of user input for driving computational processes and applications. The use of neural interfaces allows the user to directly sync up with the machine of their choice, culminating in  a man-machine symbiosis.

When I was at the Indian Sonic Research Organisation, I used the emg sensors lying around to build a simple neural interface driven by muscle activity signals. Nikhil helped me with knowing where and how to place it, but the trick was to catch the graph's "spike" when I streamed the data from the arduino to touchdesigner. On triggering, an animation would play.

Huge caveats, I almost burnt my skin off multiple times because of how hot the sensor got!
