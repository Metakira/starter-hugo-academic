Ever since I've watched *Akira*, psycho-kinetic powers have always fascinated me. The ability to cause large scale destruction and spontaneous creation through pure application of the human mind has always been something I've wanted to build and prototypes. Realtime Machine learning, as a process, really opens up a ton of possibilities in this regard. Here, I trained [Wekinator ](http://www.wekinator.org/)to recognize two of my gestures fed into it via Hand-OSC, an application that feeds in hand-tracking data via Open Sound Control. I then mapped this into a physics sim in Touchdesigner, allowing for an amusing display of primitive computer based PSI powers
